A holon (Greek: ὅλον, holon neuter form of ὅλος, holos "whole") is something
that is simultaneously a whole and a part. The word was used by Arthur
Koestler in his book The Ghost in the Machine (1967, p. 48) and the phrase to
hólon is a Greek word preceding the Latin analogue universum, in the sense of
totality, a whole. -- Wikipedia
